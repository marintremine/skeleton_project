# Skeleton Project

This project serves as a skeleton for building web applications using Django, HTMX, Alpine.js, Tailwind CSS, and Franken UI.

## Introduction

The Skeleton Project provides a starting point for developers who want to quickly set up a web application with a modern tech stack. It incorporates the following technologies:

- Django: A high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
- HTMX: A library that allows you to create dynamic web pages with minimal JavaScript by leveraging HTML attributes.
- Alpine.js: A lightweight JavaScript framework for building interactive web interfaces.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-designed components and styling options.
- Franken UI: A UI component library built on top of Tailwind CSS, offering a collection of reusable UI elements.
